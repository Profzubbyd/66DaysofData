### Day 1
I'm very excited to be a part of this challenge.
- Today I learnt more about Github through a freeCodeCamp video: https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk
- I created a repository for this challenge to have a detailed record of my progress.
- I learnt about External dictionaries in Python. How to work with them and get more details about them. I learnt this through the Kaggle course: https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/working-with-external-libraries

### Day 2
- Today I finished the Kaggle Python course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python
- It covered functions, loops, booleans, lists, strings and libraries. It was a really practical course.

### Day 3
- Learnt about Data Ethics and Scaling Machine Learning today from the Data Science from Home Podcast. Good episodes
- Data Ethics are principles that guide people to do good while using data to build anything

#### 5 Principles guiding Data Ethics
1. Human centric: Interest of human before commercial gain.
2. Equality: Should show reality of how diverse we are adn the impact to other different communities
3. Control: Full control to individuals you want to help
4. Transparency: Say what you do and do what you say. People should understand clearly what they are buying into.
5. Accountable: Be accountable through out the whole process from data collection to decision making.

- I also learnt about scaling and handling big data. GPUs do a good job here because they are faster than CPUs but a lot less RAM.
- Tools for scaling include Hadoop, Spark, RAPIDS, Dask.
- I've always been seeing RAPIDS around but today I learnt what it means. Excited about the days ahead.

### Day 4
- Today I started the Kaggle course Intro to SQL and completed 3 modules with practice exercises.
- I learnt the full meaning of SQL. Didn't know this before.
- Also how to access and examine BigQuery Datasets. Learnt about clients, projects, tables, etc
- Learnt how to write SQL queries with SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and COUNT.
- Learnt that there are datasets as large as 3TB. Wow!!! This is why you need to set a limit on queries you fetch.
- I saw that it is really with SQL we can really analyse and ask interesting questions about data.

- Also listened to "Becoming a machine learning practitioner" on O'Reilly Data Show Podcast. Was a great listen.
- A good was to learn ML is through building a project then learning the data science process behind it.
- The host uses AWS and codes as an Amazon ML developer.
- I learnt the value of attending lots of technical conferences.
- I also learnt that ML practitioners also have a reponsibility of educating their managers on ML use-cases since they are at the decison making layer.
