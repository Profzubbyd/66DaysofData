### Day 1
I'm very excited to be a part of this challenge.
- Today I learnt more about Github through a freeCodeCamp video: https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk
- I created a repository for this challenge to have a detailed record of my progress.
- I learnt about External dictionaries in Python. How to work with them and get more details about them. I learnt this through the Kaggle course: https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/working-with-external-libraries

### Day 2
- Today I finished the Kaggle Python course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python
- It covered functions, loops, booleans, lists, strings and libraries. It was a really practical course.
