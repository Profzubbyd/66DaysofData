### Day 1
I'm very excited to be a part of this challenge.
- Today I learnt more about Github through a freeCodeCamp video: https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk
- I created a repository for this challenge to have a detailed record of my progress.
- I learnt about External dictionaries in Python. How to work with them and get more details about them. I learnt this through the Kaggle course: https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/working-with-external-libraries

### Day 2
- Today I finished the Kaggle Python course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python
- It covered functions, loops, booleans, lists, strings and libraries. It was a really practical course.

### Day 3
- Learnt about Data Ethics and Scaling Machine Learning today from the Data Science from Home Podcast. Good episodes
- Data Ethics are principles that guide people to do good while using data to build anything

#### 5 Principles guiding Data Ethics
1. Human centric: Interest of human before commercial gain.
2. Equality: Should show reality of how diverse we are adn the impact to other different communities
3. Control: Full control to individuals you want to help
4. Transparency: Say what you do and do what you say. People should understand clearly what they are buying into.
5. Accountable: Be accountable through out the whole process from data collection to decision making.

- I also learnt about scaling and handling big data. GPUs do a good job here because they are faster than CPUs but a lot less RAM.
- Tools for scaling include Hadoop, Spark, RAPIDS, Dask.
- I've always been seeing RAPIDS around but today I learnt what it means. Excited about the days ahead.

### Day 4
- Today I started the Kaggle course Intro to SQL and completed 3 modules with practice exercises. I learnt the full meaning of SQL. Didn't know this before. Also how to access and examine BigQuery Datasets. Learnt about clients, projects, tables, etc. Learnt how to write SQL queries with SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and COUNT. Learnt that there are datasets as large as 3TB. Wow!!! This is why you need to set a limit on queries you fetch. I saw that it is really with SQL we can really analyse and ask interesting questions about data.

- Also listened to "Becoming a machine learning practitioner" on O'Reilly Data Show Podcast. Was a great episode. A good was to learn ML is through building a project then learning the data science process behind it. The host uses AWS and codes as an Amazon ML developer. I learnt the value of attending lots of technical conferences. I also learnt that ML practitioners also have a reponsibility of educating their managers on ML use-cases since they are at the decison making layer.

### Day 5
- Today I completed the Kaggle course: Intro to SQL. Learnt about ORDER BY, AS WITH, CTEs and JOINING tables. I just found myself loving SQL. I realized you can ask so many interesting questions and also make analysis from several datasets (and tables in them). I highly recommend the course.
- I also listened to "One Hot 2020" on Not So Standard Deviations Podcast. I learnt a lot of use-cases of AI(Artificial Intelligence) and ML(Machine Learning). The hosts Roger Peng and Hilary Parker analysed the differences between AI and ML. To mention one, AI systems come to you as a person and there's always real-time interaction eg self driving cars while ML just uses data from your past activities like recommender systems, Google Autofill, etc. It was a fun episode.

### Day 6
- Today I continued my "Big Data with Python" course being offered by Utiva which I take every weekend. They have a great instructor. I learnt about Pandas today.
- Specifically, I learnt that pandas is very fundamental for any Data Scientist. 
- Also learnt about Pandas Series, Dataframes and several things that can be done with them.
- I couldn't get enough eartime today on a Data Science related podcast but I'll post on that tomorrow.
